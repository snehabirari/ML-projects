# Semiconductor-Data-ML-Project

Introduction to a Data Science Project on the UCI ML Repository SECOM Dataset
Dataset Overview:

This project centers around the analysis of the SECOM dataset, a substantial and detailed collection of data from a semiconductor manufacturing process.

The data set contains 1567 rows, with 591 features. These features represent various measurements and sensor readings captured during the manufacturing process.

The second data set consists of corresponding labels for each row, providing a pass/fail classification along with a date-time stamp that marks the point of each test within the manufacturing cycle.

Data Characteristics:

Reflecting real-world data conditions, the SECOM dataset authors alert the Data Scientist embarking on this project of the presence of null values, with the intensity of these missing values varying across different features. This aspect of the dataset is a common challenge in data analysis and will be addressed through thoughtful pre-processing techniques.

Project Objective:

The primary goal of this machine learning project is to uncover and understand the most predictive features that influence the pass/fail outcomes of the semiconductor manufacturing process.

The stakeholder has requested us to identify a subset of features that hold the most significant predictive power, and explore the causal relationships among these key features and how they impact the overall pass/fail rates, providing insights that could be vital for process improvement and quality control.
